She would chew it all day but it is not allowed at school. She keeps some in her bag to chew on her way home from school.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span class="paragraphNumber">2</span>One day, Sarah wanted to share some of her gum with her friends. She had just learned how to blow bubbles and wanted to show them. Sarah blew a bubble as big as a soccer ball! But then, the bubble popped. It went everywhere! Sarah <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wiped</span> it from her face with her sleeve, but there was gum stuck in her hair! Sarah’s friend Amy said that in Girl Scouts, she had learned that peanut butter can be used to make gum less sticky.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://files.tangosoftware.com/DataDrive1/TangoCentral/KentroImageRepository/TX_TangoSpotlightISD/ff3b24c5-1ffc-4391-9427-949fb092ae48.jpg" width="171" height="171"></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span class="paragraphNumber">3</span>When Sarah got home, she took the peanut butter from the cupboard. She put it on the gum in her hair. She left it there for a few minutes just like Amy had told her. When it was time to take the gum out, it had worked! She pulled the gum out piece by piece. Sarah was so glad it was out! Now all she had to do was wash out the peanut butter.</p></div></div>
